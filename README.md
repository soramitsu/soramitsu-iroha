Iroha is a simple and efficient blockchain ledger based on the **distributed ledger technology (DLT)**. Its design principles are inspired by the Japanese Kaizen principle of eliminating excesses (*muri*).

Iroha can help you manage your accounts, assets, on-chain data storage with efficient smart contracts, while being Byzantine- and crash-fault tolerant.

## Features

Iroha is a fully-featured blockchain ledger. With Iroha you can:

* Create and manage custom fungible assets, such as currencies, gold, and others
* Create and manage non-fungible assets
* Manage user accounts with a domain hierarchy and multi-signature transactions
* Use efficient portable smart contracts implemented either via WebAssembly or Iroha Special Instructions
* Use both permissioned and permission-less blockchain deployments

Iroha offers:

* Byzantine fault-tolerance with up to 33% fault rate  
* Efficient in-memory operations
* Extensive telemetry support out of the box
* Modular structure
* Event-driven architecture with strongly-typed events

# System Requirements

RAM and storage requirements depend on your use case: whether you need to build or deploy a network, how big it is, and so on. This table summarises the requirements:

| Use case          | CPU               | RAM   | Storage[^1] |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------|-------------|
| Build (minimum)   | Dual-core CPU     | 4GB   | 20GB        |
| Build (recommend) | AMD Ryzen™ 5 1600 | 16GB  | 40GB        |
| Deploy (small)    | Dual-core CPU     | 8GB+  | 20GB+       |
| Deploy (large)    | AMD Epyc™ 64-core | 128GB | 128GB+      |

[^1]: Note that all operations are done in RAM, so in theory Iroha can work without persistent storage. However, since synchronising blocks over the network after a power failure may take a long time, we recommend adding a hard drive.

Regarding RAM requirements:

* On average, you need 5 KiB of RAM per account. A network with 1 000 000 accounts uses 5GiB of memory.
* Each transfer or Mint instruction requires 1 KiB per instruction.
* RAM usage grows linearly, as all transactions are stored in memory. You should expect to consume more RAM with a higher TPS and uptime.

CPU considerations:

* Rust compilation highly favours multi-core CPUs such as Apple M1™, AMD Ryzen™/Threadripper™/Epyc™, and Intel Alder Lake™.
* On systems with restricted memory and many CPU cores, Iroha compilation may sometimes fail with `SIGKILL`. To avoid it, restrict the number of CPU cores using `cargo build -j <number>`, where `<number>` (without the angle brackets) is half of your RAM capacity rounded down.

# Build, Test, and Run Iroha

Prerequisites:

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
* (Optional) [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* (Optional) [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

<details> <summary> (Optional) Run included tests</summary>

Run included code tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

Run API functional tests:

```bash
cargo build
chmod +x target/debug/iroha
chmod +x target/debug/iroha_client_cli

bash ./scripts/test_env.sh setup
bash ./scripts/tests/register_mint_quantity.sh
bash ./scripts/test_env.sh cleanup
```

</details>

## Build Iroha

- Build Iroha and accompanying binaries:

  ```bash
  cargo build
  ```

- (Optional) Build the latest Iroha image:

  ```bash
  docker build . -t hyperledger/iroha2:dev
  ```

  If you skip this step, the Iroha container will be built using the latest available image.

## Run Iroha

Once you have built Iroha, you can instantiate the minimum viable network:

```
docker compose up
```

With the `docker-compose` instance running, use [Iroha Client CLI](./client_cli/README.md):

```bash
cp configs/client_cli/config.json target/debug/config.json
cd target/debug
./iroha_client_cli --help
```

# Integration

Iroha project mainly consists of the following crates:

* [`iroha`](cli) is the command-line application for deploying an Iroha peer. Contains the routing table and definitions of API endpoints.
* [`iroha_actor`](actor) provides a message passing model for Iroha components.
* [`iroha_client`](client) provides a library for building clients that communicate with peers.
* [`iroha_client_cli`](client_cli) is the reference implementation of a client.
* [`iroha_config`](config) handles configuration and documentation generation for options and run-time changes.
* [`iroha_core`](core) is the primary library used by all other crates, including the peer endpoint management.
* [`iroha_crypto`](crypto) defines cryptographic aspects of Iroha.
* [`kagami`](tools/kagami) is used to generate cryptographic keys, default genesis, configuration reference, and schema.
* [`iroha_data_model`](data_model) defines common data models in Iroha.
* [`iroha_futures`](futures) is used for `async` programming.
* [`iroha_logger`](logger) uses `tracing` to provide logging facilities.
* [`iroha_macro`](macro) provides the convenience macros.
* [`iroha_p2p`](p2p) defines peer creation and handshake logic.
* [`iroha_permissions_validators`](permissions_validators) defines permission validation logic.
* [`iroha_substrate`](substrate) is the bridge substrate `XClaim` external module.
* [`iroha_telemetry`](telemetry) is used for monitoring and analysis of telemetry data.
* [`iroha_version`](version) provides message versioning for non-simultaneous system updates.

# Maintenance

A brief overview on how to configure and maintain an Iroha instance:

- [Configuration](#configuration)
- [Endpoints](#endpoints)
- [Logging](#logging)
- [Monitoring](#monitoring)
- [Storage](#storage)
- [Scalability](#scalability)

## Configuration

You can provide configuration parameters either as a `config.json` or using environment variables. Refer to the [detailed list](./docs/source/references/config.md) of all available configuration parameters.

Configuration example you may use as a reference point: [cli/src/samples.rs](./cli/src/samples.rs)

## Endpoints

You can find the detailed list of all available endpoints in the [API specifications](./docs/source/references/api_spec.md#endpoints).

## Logging

By default, Iroha provides logs in a human-readable format and prints them out to `stdout`.

The logging level can be changed either via a [configuration option](./docs/source/references/config.md#loggermax_log_level) or at run-time using the `configuration` endpoint.

<details><summary>Example: changing log level</summary>

For example, if your Iroha instance is running at `127.0.0.1:8080` and you want to change the log level to `DEBUG` using `curl`, you should send a `POST` request with a JSON containing the new log level. Like this:
```bash
curl -X POST \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/configuration \
    -d '{"LogLevel": "DEBUG"}' -i
```
</details>

### JSON Logging Mode

Additionally, Iroha supports a JSON logging mode.

To enable it, provide the [logging file](./docs/source/references/config.md#loggerlog_file_path) to store the logs in. On UNIX, you can also specify `/dev/stdout` or `/dev/stderr` if you prefer to pipe the output to [`bunyan`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunyan).

[Log rotation](https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man5/logrotate.conf.5.html) is the responsibility of the peer administrator.

## Monitoring

The details of the `Health` endpoint can be found in the [API specifications](./docs/source/references/api_spec.md#health).

Iroha can produce both JSON-formatted as well as `prometheus`-readable metrics at the `status` and `metrics` endpoints respectively.

The [`prometheus`](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) monitoring system is the de-factor standard for monitoring long-running services such as an Iroha peer. In order to get started, [install `prometheus`](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/) and execute the following in the project root:

```
prometheus --config.file=configs/prometheus.yml
```

## Storage

The blocks are written to the `blocks` sub-folder, which is created automatically by Iroha in the working directory of the peer. Additionally, if specified, the logging file must also be stored in a user-specified directory.

No additional storage is necessary.

## Scalability

Multiple instances of Iroha peer and client binaries can be run on the same physical machine and in the same working directory. However, we recommend to give each instance a clean new working directory.

The provided `docker-compose` file showcases a minimum viable network and the general methods of using the `hyperledger/iroha2:dev` docker image for deploying a network of peers.
